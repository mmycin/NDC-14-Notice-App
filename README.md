## Website Structure

1. **Home Page**: Displays the latest notices in a clean and responsive layout. The user can scroll through and see updates from NDC.

2. **Admin Dashboard**: Managed via **Forestadmin**, this is where notices can be added, updated, or deleted.

3. **Authentication**: The backend handles authentication and ensures only authorized users can access admin features.

4. **Database Connection**: The app uses **Mongorm**, a custom MongoDB ORM package built in Go, for database operations. The database is hosted on **MongoDB Atlas** and managed with **MongoDB Compass** for local monitoring.

5. **API Layer**: Built with the **Gin** framework, the API layer is responsible for handling requests, fetching notices from the database, and sending them to the frontend.

6. **Frontend**: The UI is built with **Preact JS**, leveraging the **Bun runtime** for optimal performance. **Tailwind CSS** ensures the design is responsive and visually appealing.

7. **Requests**: The frontend communicates with the backend via **Fetch API** and **Axios JS**, ensuring seamless data flow and interaction between the client and server.
